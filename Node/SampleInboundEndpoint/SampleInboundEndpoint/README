This project demonstrates SocketLabs' "Inbound Parse" feature.

Inbound Parse allows you to have all emails going to a particular address or domain automatically dissected into their constituent parts and sent via HTTP POST requests to a processing endpoint of your choosing. This endpoint can then do something interesting with these parsed messages.

The code in this repository is an example of one such endpoint. It does the following:
    1. Collects all incoming POST events for each received email
    2. Analyzes them for some quick stats we might want to analyze in real-time for some business purpose. In this example:
        - The frequency of the top keywords in email messages, displayed in a chart
    3. Persists the parsed email messages into a database for any subsequent analysis we might want to pursue

Though just made up for this example, the analysis performed by this endpoint could be useful for, say, getting a quick idea of hot-button issues in your support-system emails. Or maybe you want to know the timeline of when people are taking action with sales inquiries emails relative to sales campaigns. Use-cases are many.

NOTE: Run the command npm install to download and install the required MongoDB and socket.io modules.
